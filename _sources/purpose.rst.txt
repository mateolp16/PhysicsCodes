Purpose
=======

Multiple computational physics codes are contained in this repository. Conventional physics taught in university courses on mechanics, waves and fields, but solved with numerical methods. The documentation of each code will be in this documentation page. Each item/subject will explain everything about how the code works, what special features it contains and what´s the physics behind it. All the codes are written in the Python programming language. For some of the themes (for example, pendulum) there will be a code to run in the Glowscript program which will consist of performing the 3D simulation in order to see more clearly how it is given the motion.

This codes are open for any person who would like to use them :). The process of learning is different for evryone and that´s such a nice thing in life, so if you think that maybe some of these codes can help you to understand more about the physics you´re being teached in College or School, go ahead!
