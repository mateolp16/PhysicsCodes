Summary (Codes and documentation)
=================================

Before you start
----------------

- The codes are programmed with numerical methods, so it is necessary that with     the help of the book mentioned in the credits you have a bit of context about what they are, how they work and what differentiates them from analytical methods.
- In case something´s wrong with some code, let me know at elizabethgran04@gmail.com and i´ll try to solve it as soon as possible.  
- Use these codes as a second option after trying for yourself to solving them. It´s very important first to try ourselves before asking for help!
- The physics codes that will be solved here will all have the force of friction. The idea was mainly to include external forces in the codes so we can watch a more realistic behavior of the movement. Following this path, some differential equations will not have an analitic solution but numerical.


Programms we´ll find in here!
-----------------------------

- Radioactive Decay 
- Free Fal
- Parabolic Motion
- Parabolic Motion with Magnus Force
- Pendulum
- GlowScript programm for pendulum
- Planetarium Motion



Next Step!
----------

- The principal Meta is to **understand** all codes here programmed.
- Try to solve the same programms with different numerical methods!
- Try to solve evrything you can analytically because solving these equations by hand can help the process of learning the physics you´re programming. It´s way easer programm physics than understand them, so go slow and try to understand the things you´re solving :) 
- Make a GitHub repository with your codes and share them!


.. math::

   \frac{ \sum_{t=0}^{N}f(t,k) }{N}
