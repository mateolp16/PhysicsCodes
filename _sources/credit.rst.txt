======================

All the codes presented here were based on the book "Computational Physics" Second Edition by Nicholas J. Giordano and Hisao Nakanishi. For some of the topics different numerical methods were used than those used on the book. These numerical methods could be more precisely for the different subjects or simply because it was easier or was assigned in this way by the teacher.

The computational physics class is taught by Professor Jaime Humberto Hoyos at the University of Medell√≠n in the Faculty of Basic Sciences. You can find information about him in here: https://investigaciones-pure.udem.edu.co/es/persons/jaime-humberto-hoyos-barrios

This codes were made in the second half of the year 2023-2 by student Elizabeth Granda in the class we previously mentioned.
