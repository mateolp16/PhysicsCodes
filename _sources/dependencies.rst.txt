Dependencies
============

As mentioned earlier, the codes in this repository are all written in the Python programming language. Python is a very powerful, useful and easy to use dynamic language compared to lower level languages. Due to its great success, there are many environments to program in Python today. Personally, as a computer science student, notebooks depeloved in "Jupyter Notebook" or "Google Colab", that is, markdown with code, have been a great help throughout my whole undergrate. So in case that you donÂ´t have Python and its dependencies installed in your local machine, you can use Google Colab and all your work will be in the cloud. Also Jupyter Notebook or Spyder or any environment you like.
